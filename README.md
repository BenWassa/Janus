# Project Janus
A retro-inspired text RPG where your story shapes ‚Äî and secretly reveals ‚Äî your psychological profile. Decisions guide the plot and quietly measure traits like openness, risk tolerance, and attachment style, culminating in a personalized "Hero'\''s Chronicle" of mind and myth.

## Project Overview
Project Janus blends the charm of a classic text-based fantasy adventure with the intrigue of hidden psychological profiling. Every choice you make ‚Äî in quests, dialogues, and moral dilemmas ‚Äî subtly shapes your journey and reveals the inner contours of your character.

At the end of your quest, you receive your Hero'\''s Chronicle:
- A narrative recap of your adventures
- An inferred profile across traits like the Big Five, risk tolerance, attachment style, and more
- Insights into how your decisions reflected (or defied) your underlying tendencies

## Core Features
- Branching narrative with multiple endings
- Covert psychological scoring system
- Replayable scenarios with different personality outcomes
- Modular design for adding new quests, dilemmas, and scoring frameworks

## Project Structure

### üìÅ `/data/` - Game Content
Structured game data separated from code for easy modification and localization. Contains quests, characters, scenarios, and their psychological assessment mappings. [See data README](data/README.md) for content creation guidelines.

### üìÅ `/src/` - Source Code
Core system implementation divided into specialized modules:

#### `/src/core/` - Game Engine
Fundamental components including the main game loop, rendering system, input handling, and state management. [See core README](src/core/README.md) for architecture details.

#### `/src/game/` - Game Logic
RPG-specific mechanics, quest systems, character interactions, and narrative flow management. [See game README](src/game/README.md) for gameplay implementation.

#### `/src/psychology/` - Profiling System
Covert psychological assessment engine that analyzes player decisions and generates personality profiles. [See psychology README](src/psychology/README.md) for assessment methodologies.

#### `/src/utils/` - Utilities
Shared helper functions, configuration management, and common tools used across the project. [See utils README](src/utils/README.md) for available utilities.

### üìÅ `/versions/` - Development Iterations
Version-specific implementations showing project evolution:

#### `/versions/v1-prototype/` - Working Pilot
Complete playable "Labyrinth of Three Doors" prototype demonstrating core concepts. [See v1 README](versions/v1-prototype/README.md) for pilot details.

#### `/versions/v2-alpha/` - Enhanced Version
Expanded feature set with improved psychology engine and additional content. [See v2 README](versions/v2-alpha/README.md) for alpha features.

#### `/versions/v3-beta/` - Production Candidate
Feature-complete beta with polished UI, comprehensive testing, and deployment readiness. [See v3 README](versions/v3-beta/README.md) for beta status.

### üìÅ `/prototype/` - Experimental Development
Research and experimentation space for testing new concepts, algorithms, and game mechanics before integration into main versions. [See prototype README](prototype/README.md) for experimental features.

### üìÅ `/tests/` - Quality Assurance
Comprehensive testing suite including unit tests for individual components and integration tests for system-wide functionality. [See tests README](tests/README.md) for testing procedures.

### üìÅ `/docs/` - Documentation
Complete project documentation including game design documents, technical guides, psychology methodologies, and user manuals. [See docs README](docs/README.md) for documentation structure.

### üìÅ `/deployment/` - Release Management
Production deployment configuration, build processes, and release management tools for distributing the game across multiple platforms. [See deployment README](deployment/README.md) for release procedures.

## Getting Started

1. **Play the Prototype**: Try the v1 pilot in `/versions/v1-prototype/` to experience the core concept
2. **Explore the Code**: Review `/src/` modules to understand the architecture
3. **Read the Docs**: Check `/docs/` for comprehensive design and technical documentation
4. **Run Tests**: Execute test suites in `/tests/` to verify system functionality

## Vision
Future versions may expand into adaptive NPC behavior, multiplayer "party dynamics" profiling, and ethically designed research modules for psychological studies.

## Development Principles
- **Ethical Psychology**: Transparent, opt-in profiling with clear privacy protections
- **Modular Design**: Easy extension and modification of game content and mechanics
- **Player-Centric**: Engaging gameplay that naturally reveals personality traits
- **Research-Ready**: Robust data collection and analysis capabilities for academic use'
