# Project Janus
A retro-inspired text RPG where your story shapes — and secretly reveals — your psychological profile. Decisions guide the plot and quietly measure traits like openness, risk tolerance, and attachment style, culminating in a personalized “Hero’s Chronicle” of mind and myth.

Project Janus blends the charm of a classic text-based fantasy adventure with the intrigue of hidden psychological profiling. Every choice you make — in quests, dialogues, and moral dilemmas — subtly shapes your journey and reveals the inner contours of your character.

At the end of your quest, you receive your Hero’s Chronicle:

A narrative recap of your adventures

An inferred profile across traits like the Big Five, risk tolerance, attachment style, and more

Insights into how your decisions reflected (or defied) your underlying tendencies

Features

Branching narrative with multiple endings

Covert psychological scoring system

Replayable scenarios with different personality outcomes

Modular design for adding new quests, dilemmas, and scoring frameworks

Vision
Future versions may expand into adaptive NPC behaviour, multiplayer “party dynamics” profiling, and even ethically designed research modules.
