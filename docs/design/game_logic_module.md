# Game Logic Module

Conceptual design for RPG-specific mechanics and systems.

## Planned Components
- `quest_system.py` – quest management and progression
- `dialogue_system.py` – character interaction and conversation trees
- `tagging.py` – decision processing and trait tagging
- `narrative_manager.py` – story branching and flow control
- `character_manager.py` – player and NPC management

## Integration Points
- Interfaces with psychology module for decision tracking
- Uses core engine for rendering and state management
- Loads content from data directory
