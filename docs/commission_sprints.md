Sprints by Week
Sprint 1 – Trait Glossary & Tagging API
Goal: Finalize trait names, concise definitions, example behaviors, and implement the in-engine tagging method.

Deliver: Trait glossary table (12 traits, each with definition + 2–3 example in-story triggers).

Deliver: Pseudocode or function spec for tag() and normalize() in the game engine.

Deliver: Dev HUD mockup showing live trait deltas.

Deep Context to provide with stock doc:

The working trait list above.

Rubric for weights.

Example of 2–3 fully tagged scene choices.

Engine’s current choice handling format.






Sprint 2 – Content Expansion: Act 1 (Mirrors)
Goal: Add micro/mid/pocket scenes + decoys to Act 1.

Deliver: +6 micro-scenes, +2 mid-stakes, +1 optional pocket scene.

Each choice tagged with {primary trait, primary weight, secondary trait, secondary weight}.

Ensure 30–40% decoy/no-weight choices.

Deep Context:

Current Act 1 script.

Desired tone (dreamlike, self-confrontational).

Examples of low vs high-weight decisions.

How to intersperse decoys to reduce “quiz” feel.








Sprint 3 – Content Expansion: Act 2 (Beasts)
Goal: As above, but for Act 2.

Deliver: +6 micro-scenes, +2 mid-stakes, +1 optional pocket.

Emphasis on moral tests, mercy vs cruelty.

Decoy ratio maintained.

Deep Context:

Current Act 2 script.

Trait mapping for aggression, control, compassion.

How Beasts represent externalized inner flaws.







Sprint 4 – Content Expansion: Act 3 (Whispers)
Goal: As above, but for Act 3.

Deliver: +6 micro-scenes, +2 mid-stakes, +1 optional pocket.

Decoys embedded.

Deep Context:

Current Act 3 script.

Trait mapping for secrecy, temptation, loyalty.















Sprint 5 – Midgame Payoffs
Goal: Author micro & mid-scene variations triggered by top trait(s).

Deliver: 20+ micro-payoffs (ambient lines, item descriptions, NPC remarks).

Deliver: 6–8 mid-scene forks keyed to top-1 or top-2 traits.

Format: if-trait templates ready to plug into engine.

Deep Context:

Example micro-payoffs from prototypes.

Mapping of traits to thematic payoff styles.

Rules for avoiding overt trait labeling.












Sprint 6 – Endgame Reveal Library
Goal: Create 9 end-reveal variants (3×3 primary/secondary trait grid).

Deliver: Narrative templates with variables for trait titles, metaphors, tone.

Deliver: Neutral fallback reveal for ties.

Ensure each reveal feels earned from cumulative play.

Deep Context:

Trait constellation logic.

Examples of good/bad reveals from playtest feedback.

Tone guidelines: reflective, poetic, non-preachy.













Sprint 7 – Engine Polish
Goal: Add save/load, HUD toggle, telemetry logging.

Deliver: CLI options, JSON save format, sample telemetry output.

Deliver: Minimal code changes for integration.

Maintain compatibility with tagging system.

Deep Context:

Current engine loop.

Desired HUD/CLI wireframe.

JSON save spec.













Sprint 8 – Playtest & Balancing
Goal: Tune weights, decoys, and payoff frequency.

Deliver: Recommended weight adjustments.

Deliver: Revised scenes or tags where balance is off.

Deliver: Playtest feedback synthesis.

Deep Context:

Test run logs with trait deltas.
