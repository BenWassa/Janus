# Vision Document: "Hamartia" System
**Stream 2 Personality Profiling — The Heroic Flaw Continuum**

## Vision Statement

We will embed a psychological fingerprinting system in the game that identifies a player's dominant heroic flaws — hamartia — through narrative choices. The system will operate invisibly, tagging decisions to a curated set of personality archetypes, then reveal them through story payoffs rather than numeric scores.

### This will:
- **Deepen immersion** by making personality feel like a living force in the game world
- **Increase replay value** via branching narrative opportunities tied to trait profiles
- **Provide subtle, psychologically grounded self-reflection** for players without "quizzing" them

## Core Principles

### 1. Continuum over Absolutes
- Every trait sits between virtue and flaw (e.g., Confidence ↔ Arrogance, Caution ↔ Timidity)
- Keeps language human and avoids moralizing
- Players exist on spectrums rather than in binary categories

### 2. Narrative Integration
- Trait influence expressed through NPC behavior, world reactions, and epilogue content, not stat sheets
- Endgame reveal is earned via story artifacts or dialogue
- Psychology becomes part of the story fabric

### 3. Fingerprinting Through Play
- Each choice tagged with a primary and optional secondary trait category
- Accumulated over the course of play to produce a top 3–5 trait profile
- Natural decision-making reveals authentic personality patterns

### 4. Replayability by Design
- Trait profiles unlock unique dialogue, alternative solutions, and different ending beats
- Players can intentionally experiment with opposite tendencies for a fresh experience
- Multiple playthroughs reveal different aspects of personality

## Trait Categories & Representative Characteristics

| Category | Virtue → Flaw | Example Manifestations |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Hubris** | Confidence → Arrogance | Arrogant, Conceited, Entitled |
| **Avarice** | Ambition → Greed | Greedy, Possessive, Self-serving |
| **Deception** | Tact → Manipulation | Dishonest, Insincere, Sly |
| **Control & Perfectionism** | Leadership → Domineering | Perfectionist, Overbearing |
| **Anger & Revenge** | Passion → Vindictiveness | Hot-tempered, Resentful |
| **Fear & Insecurity** | Prudence → Timidity | Anxious, Self-doubting |
| **Impulsivity** | Adaptability → Recklessness | Careless, Rash |
| **Envy** | Aspiration → Covetousness | Competitive, Spiteful |
| **Apathy & Sloth** | Calm → Indifference | Neglectful, Lethargic |
| **Pessimism & Cynicism** | Realism → Defeatism | Skeptical, Distrustful |
| **Moodiness & Indirectness** | Sensitivity → Petty | Passive-aggressive, Moody |
| **Rigidity** | Resolve → Stubbornness | Inflexible, Dogmatic |

## Implementation Strategy

### Choice Tagging System
- **Primary Tag**: Main psychological trait expressed by choice
- **Secondary Tag**: Optional nuance or secondary trait
- **Weight System**: Some choices carry more psychological significance
- **Context Awareness**: Same action may have different psychological meaning in different situations

### Profile Generation
- **Top 3-5 Traits**: Dominant personality patterns emerge over gameplay
- **Threshold System**: Minimum choices required before trait becomes "dominant"
- **Balance Detection**: System recognizes when player exhibits both virtue and flaw sides
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Later choices may carry more weight as character develops

### World Response Integration
- **NPC Reactions**: Characters respond differently based on detected traits
- **Environmental Storytelling**: World details shift to reflect player psychology
- **Dialogue Unlocks**: Certain conversation options only available to specific trait profiles
- **Quest Variations**: Same objectives with different approaches based on personality

## Player Payoff Structure

### During Gameplay
- **Micro-Responses**: Small changes in how the world treats the player
- **Flavor Text**: Narrative descriptions shift to mirror developing traits
- **Emergent Opportunities**: New paths open based on psychological profile
- **Character Recognition**: NPCs begin to "know" the player's nature

### Endgame Revelation
- **Climactic Reveal**: An artifact, prophecy, or major NPC names the heroic flaw profile
- **Narrative Integration**: The reveal feels earned and meaningful within the story
- **Multiple Formats**: Various ways to present the psychological insight (oracle, mirror, judgment, etc.)

### Epilogue Customization
- **Trait-Specific Endings**: Customized conclusions based on top traits
- **Dual Interpretations**: Both cautionary and celebratory aspects of traits
- **Future Implications**: How the character's nature might shape their continuing story
- **Reflection Opportunities**: Moments for players to consider their revealed psychology

## Technical Considerations

### Data Structure
- **Choice Metadata**: Each decision carries trait tags and weights
- **Profile Tracking**: Running tally of trait manifestations
- **Threshold Management**: System for determining when traits become "dominant"
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining narrative coherence with psychological reveals

### Content Creation Guidelines
- **Natural Integration**: Psychological elements must feel organic to story
- **Avoiding Telegraphing**: Players shouldn't easily game the system
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Traits presented without moral judgment
- **Accessibility**: System works for players of varying psychological awareness

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
- Implement choice tagging system
- Build profile generation algorithms
- Create basic trait detection mechanics

### Phase 2: World Integration
- Develop NPC response systems
- Create trait-influenced content variations
- Build environmental storytelling elements

### Phase 3: Revelation Systems
- Design endgame reveal mechanisms
- Create customized epilogue content
- Implement replayability features

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing
- Validate psychological accuracy
- Ensure narrative coherence
- Test for gaming/exploitation
- Refine for optimal player experience

## Success Metrics

### Player Engagement
- **Replay Rate**: Players returning to explore different personality paths
- **Session Length**: Extended engagement due to psychological intrigue
- **Discussion Generation**: Players sharing and comparing their revealed traits

### Psychological Validity
- **Accuracy Assessment**: Correlation between revealed traits and player self-reporting
- **Consistency Testing**: Similar choices leading to similar trait detection
- **Expert Review**: Validation by psychology professionals

### Narrative Integration
- **Immersion Maintenance**: Psychological elements enhance rather than break story flow
- **Reveal Satisfaction**: Players find their trait reveals meaningful and accurate
- **Replayability Evidence**: Different trait paths provide genuinely different experiences

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy & Consent
- Clear communication about psychological profiling
- Opt-in rather than mandatory participation
- Data handling transparency

### Psychological Safety
- Avoid pathologizing normal personality variations
- Present traits as neutral characteristics rather than flaws
- Provide context for psychological insights

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Ensure trait interpretations work across cultural contexts
- Avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes
- Include diverse perspectives in development
