# Prototype & Experimentation Area

This directory is for rapid prototyping, feature experiments, and concept validation.

## Purpose
- Test new ideas without affecting main codebase
- Validate concepts before full implementation
- Experiment with different approaches
- Rapid iteration and feedback

## Guidelines
- Keep experiments small and focused
- Document findings and decisions
- Clean up completed experiments
- Move successful concepts to main codebase

## Current Experiments
(Add your experiments here as you create them)
