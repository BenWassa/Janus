# Humility-Hubris Asset Pack

This folder contains the coherent visual language for the prototype.

## Portrait motifs

`portraits/` holds eight minimalist SVG silhouettes sized for 64Ã—64 rendering.
Each icon uses two flat colors and `currentColor` so the accent hue can be
applied via CSS.

## Style tokens

Color, typography and motion tokens are centralized in `../style.css`.
Animations use the shared `--motion-emphasis-duration` and
`--motion-emphasis-ease` values to keep motion subtle.
