# Scenario Files

Act-based scene collections defining micro, mid, and pocket encounters. Each scene contains narrative text and trait-weighted choices.

## Weights
- `0.0` – decoy narrative choice
- `0.2` – micro choice, minor signal
- `0.5` – mid choice, moderate signal
- `0.8` – high-impact choice

Sprint 10 expands coverage with additional micro-scenes, decoys, and high-weight options across all acts to better disguise direct trait links.
